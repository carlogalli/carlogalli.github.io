Default only affects sophisticated bond traders, whereas inflation concerns a larger and less informed group. Within a two-period Bayesian trading game, differential information manifests itself in the secondary market, and we display conditions under which debt prices are more resilient to bad news even in the primary market, where only sophisticated players operate.

I consider a sovereign default model with fiscal policy and private capital accumulation. I show that, when fiscal policy responds to borrowing conditions in the sovereign debt market, multiple equilibria exist where the expectations of lenders are self-fulfilling. In the bad equilibrium, pessimistic beliefs make sovereign debt costly. The government substitutes borrowing with taxation, which depresses private investment and future output, increases default probabilities and verifies lenders' beliefs. This result is reminiscent of the European debt crisis of 2010-12: while recessionary, fiscal austerity may be the government best response to excessive borrowing costs during a confidence crisis.","tags":[],"title":"Self-Fulfilling Debt Crises, Fiscal Policy and Investment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["[Iovino](https://sites.google.com/site/luigiiovino/)","[Sergeyev](https://sites.google.com/site/dmitriysergeyev/)"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1535587200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1535587200,"objectID":"8c0f36f97093eedca82e5358988d9f2d","permalink":"https://carlogalli.github.io/discussion/iovino-sergeyev/","publishdate":"2018-08-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/discussion/iovino-sergeyev/","section":"discussion","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Central Bank Balance Sheet Policies Without Rational Expectations","type":"discussion"},{"authors":["Carlo Galli"],"categories":["Demo"],"content":"Create a free website with Academic using Markdown, Jupyter, or RStudio.
