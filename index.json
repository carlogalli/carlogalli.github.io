I consider a sovereign default model with fiscal policy and private capital accumulation. I show that, when fiscal policy responds to borrowing conditions in the sovereign debt market, multiple equilibria exist where the expectations of lenders are self-fulfilling. In the bad equilibrium, pessimistic beliefs make sovereign debt costly. The government substitutes borrowing with taxation, which depresses private investment and future output, increases default probabilities and verifies lenders' beliefs. This result is reminiscent of the European debt crisis of 2010-12: while recessionary, fiscal austerity may be the government best response to excessive borrowing costs during a confidence crisis.","tags":[],"title":"Self-Fulfilling Debt Crises, Fiscal Policy and Investment","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1586131200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586131200,"objectID":"c6cbc975e668306a359e84850b45a7b6","permalink":"https://carlogalli.github.io/research_page/","publishdate":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research_page/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Research Page","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1586131200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586131200,"objectID":"e8f025c9cb27d1ba272710a2a7f64e57","permalink":"https://carlogalli.github.io/teaching_page/","publishdate":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching_page/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Teaching Page","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":["Carlo Galli"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1581292800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1581292800,"objectID":"0e65e86296affb09905479e29b388ac9","permalink":"https://carlogalli.github.io/publication/galli-nominaldebt/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/galli-nominaldebt/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper explores the trade-off between strategic inflation and default for a set of large emerging market economies that borrow mostly in their local currency.","tags":null,"title":"Inflation, Default Risk and Nominal Debt","type":"publication"},{"authors":["[Marco Bassetto](http://users.nber.org/~bassetto/)","Carlo Galli"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1569888000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569888000,"objectID":"6ff137ea0a92bbc69bfdb9d93e618f53","permalink":"https://carlogalli.github.io/publication/bassetto-galli-aer/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bassetto-galli-aer/","section":"publication","summary":"We study the information sensitivity of government debt denominated in domestic vs. foreign currency: the former is subject to inflation risk and the latter to default.

Within a two-period Bayesian trading game, differential information manifests itself in the secondary market, and we display conditions under which debt prices are more resilient to bad news even in the primary market, where only sophisticated players operate.
